## About the project

This project was developed following
a public design [available at Figma's community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1016073914586012770).
All the responsiveness was developed
from scratch, and the final result is not
a one-to-one copy by design decision.

Currently, the project is hosted on vercel,
you can check the end result by
